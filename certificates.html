        Throughout this module, I embarked on an enriching learning journey to
        understand the building blocks of web development. I acquired a
        comprehensive understanding of HTML, the fundamental markup language
        that forms the backbone of web pages. CSS empowered me to apply styles
        and layouts to HTML elements, making them attractive and visually
        engaging. Additionally, I explored the power of Bootstrap, a popular
        front-end framework that accelerated my development process by providing
        a wide range of pre-designed components and responsive layout utilities.

        During this comprehensive module, I delved into the world of JavaScript,
        a versatile and powerful scripting language that plays a pivotal role in
        modern web development. I gained a deep understanding of JavaScript
        fundamentals, including variables, data types, functions, and control
        flow, which allowed me to write dynamic and interactive code. The
        module's emphasis on Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation enabled me
        to create dynamic web pages that respond to user interactions. I learned
        to harness the power of JavaScript to create engaging user experiences
        and build interactive web applications.
